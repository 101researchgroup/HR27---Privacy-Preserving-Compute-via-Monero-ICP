# HR27 — Overview

## Title
Privacy-Preserving Compute via Monero × ICP

## Abstract (Extended)
This document formalizes security-native and intent-driven computation
within the Quansistor Field Computing stack.

It defines strict semantic boundaries between intent, execution,
verification, and interpretation, with an emphasis on determinism,
replayability, and audit without authority.

No asset transfer, cross-chain execution, or trust assumptions are made.

## Keywords
QFC, QFM, QVM, SMRK-Hamiltonian, Intent-Bridges, operator-based computation

## Relation to the QFC Stack
This work integrates with SMRK Deployment Layer (QDL), SMRK Network,
SMRK Probe & Verifier, and QVM governance semantics.

## Intended Use
Formal research reference, governance architecture, security analysis,
and reproducible verification frameworks.
